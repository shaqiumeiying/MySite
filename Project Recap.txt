Summary:

1. Embed 3d model to web using three drei

2. convert glb/gltf to jsx through npx gltfjsx

3. if export blender in seperate gltf file, resize textures, then import back to Blender then export as embedded gltf, size will dramatically decrease. 
(with builtin compression, will have even bgetter optimization result)

4. 3d animation, pose, key frames (ctrl + i)




Next step todos/challenges:

1. webgl/opengl toon shader

2. better website optimization

3. more projects

4. maybe add a "work" section
